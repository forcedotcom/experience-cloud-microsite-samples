The Experience Cloud Microsite sample repository contains a collection of reference implementations for Experience Cloud Microsite projects. It is structured in two parts: examples and SFDX.

The SFDX section is designed for developers that use the SFDX environment. There are no source files in this section because they are converted from the metadata format (in "Examples") to the SFDX format by running the script in the SFDX directory. After the files are converted to the SFDX format, the developer is responsible for maintaining the files and working with them in the new SFDX project.
